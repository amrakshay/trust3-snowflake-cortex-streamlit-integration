## 🔐 Safeguarding Cortex with Trust3

### 📘 Use Case 1: Auditing Conversations with Cortex Analyst via Trust3

#### 🧪 Try This in Your Streamlit Application

Ask the following question in your Streamlit app:

> **💬 "What are our top 3 client deals?"**

You will receive a response from the Cortex Analyst via the Streamlit application (see example in the screenshot below).

<img src="images/1.png" border="1px solid"/>

### 📊 View the Audit Logs in Trust3

To audit this conversation:

1. Navigate to the **Trust3 Portal**.
2. Go to **Observability > Access Audits**.
3. You will see the **latest entry** at the top for your recent conversation.

<img src="images/2.png" border="1px solid"/>

### 🔍 Dive Deeper

* Click on **More Details** to inspect the full **prompt and response trail** for that conversation.
* Expand each section to get detailed insight into the interaction — including system messages, user queries, and LLM-generated responses.

> 🛡️ This ensures complete visibility and traceability of every LLM interaction, enhancing both **security** and **compliance**.

<img src="images/3.png" border="1px solid"/>

## 📘 Use Case 2: Safeguarding Conversations with Cortex Search using Trust3

### 🎭 Step 1: Query as `account_executive` Role

1. In **Snowsight**, switch your role to **`account_executive`**.

2. Start the **Streamlit application**.

3. Ask the following question:

   > 💬 **"Which discovery-stage client expressed interest in our API ecosystem and required a detailed platform migration plan?"**

4. ✅ You will receive a **complete and expected response** from the Streamlit app.

<img src="images/4.png" border="1px solid"/>

5. Navigate to **Trust3 Portal → Observability → Access Audits** to view the audit trail.

   * You will see a **new top entry** representing this conversation.
   * Click **More Details** to view the prompt, response, and filters.

### 🎭 Step 2: Query as `sales_manager` Role

1. Now, **switch your role** in Snowsight to **`sales_manager`**.

2. Ask the **same question** again in the Streamlit app.

3. ❗This time, the **response will be different** — Trust3 has applied filtering based on your role.

<img src="images/5.png" border="1px solid"/>

### 🔍 Why the Answers Differ

* Trust3 applies **Dynamic Filtering** based on the user's current role.
* The underlying **context table used by Cortex** has a `groups` column, listing role access for each record.
* Only `account_executive` had access to the relevant row.
* Trust3 dynamically injected filters so that **Cortex Search retrieved only authorized context documents**.

<img src="images/6.png" border="1px solid"/>

### 🕵️ View Dynamic Filter in Audit Logs

* Go back to **Access Audits** in Trust3.
* Open the same conversation as `sales_manager`.
* Click on **More Details** to inspect the filters sent to Cortex.

<img src="images/7.png" border="1px solid"/>

> 🔐 **Trust3 ensures each user sees only what they’re authorized to see — without modifying your app logic.**
